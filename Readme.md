## What is this
A Repository to play around with Unit-Test for learning Purposes

Its inspired and followed by
https://thephp.website/en/issue/real-life-tdd-php/

All steps are done so far.

### Next steps 

follow the ideas to extend the test cases / development of classes like:

>+ I'd like to have a PSR-18 compatible http client and remove the file_get_contents() call
>+ I'd like to split our test into unit and integration
>+ I'd like to have a better hydration for Metadata class

>Also important to notice we didn't test any exception case. Those should be part of your implementation as well! How should the program behave when identifier doesn't exist?
